### What new package do you want?

foobar 2.0.x

### Why?

In foobar 2.0.0, the --whiz-bang flag was added.  This feature would be very
useful to me, and RHEL 7 only has foobar 1.8.1.

### Testing

I agree to test the new package to ensure that it works as expected.  Once I am
satisfied with the results of my testing I will comment on this issue with the
word "STABLE" to get it promoted to the stable repos.
