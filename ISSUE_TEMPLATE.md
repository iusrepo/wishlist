### What package do you want?

foobar 2.0.x

### Why?

In foobar 2.0.0, the --whiz-bang flag was added.  This feature would be very
useful to me.  RHEL 6 only has foobar 1.7.8, and RHEL 7 only has foobar 1.8.1.

### OS versions

I would like this package for both RHEL 6 and 7.

### Testing

I agree to test the new package to ensure that it works as expected.
